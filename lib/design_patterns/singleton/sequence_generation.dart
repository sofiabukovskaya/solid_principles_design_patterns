/// Exercise #1
/// 1. Create a Singleton implementation which will generate a sequence of numbers to the callers.
/// a. The idea here is that there is only a single number/sequence generator and all the numbers follow a perfect sequence.
/// b. So when we do a call to the generator like getNextNumber() we should get the next number in the sequence no matter how we obtained the generator.
/// 2. Make that implementation both with eager-instantiation and with lazy-instantiation.
/// a. Which one would you prefer to use and why?
